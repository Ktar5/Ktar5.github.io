## Summary
The Uncensored Library ([Check out the project website here!](https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en)) is a collaboration between [Blockworks](https://www.blockworks.uk/) (a creative design studio working with Minecraft) and [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en)(an international non-profit and non-governmental organization that safeguards the right to freedom of information). The project ended up getting mass-media attention. I served as the sole software engineer and system admin for this project, contracted by Blockworks. The goal of The Uncensored Library was to capitalize on the fact that many countries that censor the internet, still have access to the video game Minecraft, and to post censored books and other media within this online game.

## My Responsibilities
I was contacted by James Delanely, the CEO of Blockworks, to be the system admin and software engineer for the duration of the project. After getting the Minecraft server setup on the dedicated server box, I created custom software to protect the integrity of The Uncensored Library itself. For the next day after release, I closely monitored the actions of the players, and updated the custom software to prevent any newly observed occurences of spam, bots, and other harmful attempts at manipulating the server or attempting to take it down.
