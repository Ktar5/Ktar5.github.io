title: "DuckyONE 2 RGB Keyboard Backlight Control"
date: 2019-04-05
excerpt: "I own a DuckyONE 2 RGB keyboard. I've always had a fantasy of controlling the lights on my keyboard through code, so I reverse engineered how the RGB control software was communicating with the keyboard and emulated it! Flashy RGB has never been so great."
