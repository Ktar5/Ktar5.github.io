## Summary
[Link to project on GitHub](https://github.com/Ktar5/ProcLib)
(Has a pretty beautiful readme :))

![demo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dceaaa6ea26c5723e97fb95e15727e9276a50866/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f37395a613458372e676966)

Skills used:
Java, Git, Gradle, Algorithms

This library was created with inspiration from @Durango and was my first exploration into the world of algorithms and data structures pre-university. It was very interesting to explore the different factors that allow procedural generation to take place. While not the most advanced, I hope to come back to this project some day and add more features.


## Process
Over the course of about a week, I started sifting through various random generation algorithms and implemented them into this library that I was creating.

While I'm not artistically minded as much as Durango was who created the beautiful displays of random generation, I did get to implement quite a few algorithms with quite a few options.

Obviously I have the basics like transforms (rotating, flipping, painting, stretching, mirroring), and some other basic mutators such as smoothing, generating shapes, partitioning, finding blobs, connecting blobs.

I was working on this the Summer before university, so this was my first time delving into algorithms such as Dijkstra's graph algorithms

## Inspiration
Not too long ago, I came across a [really neat library](https://chilly-durango.itch.io/level-generator-toolkit) for this game making program called Construct 2 on itch.io and was just fascinated by the beautiful things that the library could do like in this gif:

Honestly, how could you not think this is absolutely wild. I ended up playing around with this tool for hours before deciding to try to re-implement some of these mechanics in my own code as a coding exercise.
